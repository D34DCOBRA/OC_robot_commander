# OC_robot_commander
This set of scripts allows you to control an OpenComputers robot from OC computer using buttons.

# DISCLAIMER:
This script isn't even done yet. You can currently only move up and down. (Have been busy working on the backend stuff.)

the buttonAPI is originally created by dw20 (minecraft youtuber) for ComputerCraft and ported by the guy in the link, 

so 99,9% of credists goes to him. https://oc.cil.li/index.php?/topic/255-button-api-now-for-oc-updated-9-6-2014/

BUT, i have updated it to include the additional feature made after it was ported. so the original demo in the link above won't work.

# To use:
1. download a copy of the repo and unzip it

2. Move files below to corresponding folders

                 "FILE:"                "WHERE"                "ON:"
                 
            "buttonAPI.lua"             "lib"                "computer"
            
            "Robot_Commander.lua"       "root"               "computer"
            
            "robot_remote.lua"          "bin"                "computer"
            
            "robotLib.lua"              "root"               "robot"

3. navigate to "home" directory on the robot (boots here by default) type the command "edit .shrc" without quotes and add the following "/robotLib.lua" without quotes.

4. Ensure that both the computer and the robot have a linked card.

5. You'll have to use T3 server or a creative case. (by default you need T3 graphics card and the linked card is also T3)

6. Create an issue if you can't get it to work.

7. Pastebin links to come:

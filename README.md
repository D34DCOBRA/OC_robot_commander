# OC_robot_commander
This set of scripts allows you to control an OpenComputers robot from OC computer using buttons.

# DISCLAIMER:
This script isn't even done yet. You can currently only move up and down. (Have been busy working on the backend stuff.)

# To use:
1. download a copy of the repo and unzip it
2. move the "buttonAPI.lua" file to the "lib" folder on your "computer".
            "Robot_Commander.lua"       "root"               "computer".
            "robot_remote.lua"          "bin"                "computer".
            "robotLib.lua"              "root"               "robot".
3. navigate to "home" directory (boots here by default) type the command "edit .shrc" without quotes and add th following "/robotLib.lua" without quotes
4. Ensure that both the computer and the robot have a linked card.
5. You'll have to use T3 server or a creative case. (by default you need T3 graphics card and the linked card is also T3)

6. Create an issue if you cant get it to work.
